_ = Page(name="overview", title=u"Comox Overview", description=u"", content=u"""h1. Comox Overview

h2. History

First settled by the Salish, the name Comox is derived from the Indian word "Koumuckthay", meaning "Land of Plenty". The "Port of Comox":http://www.comoxfishermanswharf.com/marine_history/ was founded in the mid 1800's on the slopes of the Comox Peninsula. Overlooking the protected waters of Comox Harbour, it was an important port for the ships of the Royal Navy and transport steamers.

Today Comox is primarily residential in nature, with a population of about 12,000 and covers some 1500 hectares. Located in the centre of a rich agricultural area producing potatoes, vegetables, fruit and dairy products, Comox retains a friendly village atmosphere.

Our moderate climate, unsurpassed recreational opportunities and comprehensive community services are just three of the reasons that Comox is rapidly becoming known as a retirement mecca.

h2. Tourism

"*Comox Valley Visitor Centre*":http://www.comoxvalleychamber.com/visitor-centre

"Tourism":recreation-tourism is a growth industry with Comox being ideally situated to act as a base for the enjoyment of the wonderful outdoor resources available in the area.

p(fr). !http://comox.ca/site-graphics/glacier1page.jpg!

Comox is well served by a modern new highway south to Nanaimo and Victoria, and north to Campbell River. The older Island Highway serves the logging, mining and fishing communities north of Campbell River. There is a "ferry":http://www.bcferries.bc.ca/ to Powell River on the Canadian Mainland, and&nbsp;"Comox Valley Airport":http://www.comoxairport.com/ which has several&nbsp;scheduled flights daily to the City of Vancouver and island destinations. BC Transit operates a "local bus service":http://www.busonline.ca/regions/com/?p=2.list within the Comox Valley.

h2. CFB Comox

"CFB Comox":http://www.airforce.forces.ca/19w-19e/index-eng.asp is a integral part of the community. Having been founded in 1942 as a Royal Air Force base, CFB Comox has played a major role in shaping and supporting the community. The primary responsibilities of CFB Comox are Search and Rescue operations, maritime patrols and support of naval and air force defences. In addition to the essential roles the base plays for the community, BC and Canada, CFB Comox is a large supporter of community events routinely supplying volunteers and equipment wherever needed.

h2. Amenities

Amenities located within the town include a number of "marinas":marinas for commercial, sports fishing boats, and pleasure craft including a large number of sailboats. You will also find a well equipped volunteer fire department and commercial airport in Comox. A 9 hole golf course, modern community centre, library, the largest hospital north of Nanaimo which included extended care and psychiatric wings, and 125 hectares of parks, playing fields and reserves also service the needs of the community.

Education is provided in four Elementary and one High School which are in the "School District 71 area.":http://sd71.bc.ca/ "North Island College":http://www.nic.bc.ca/, which provides equivalency, Diploma and university transfer courses together with a wealth of leisure programs is also located in the Comox Valley.

h2. Leisure

The renowned sailing of the Inside Passage, wind surfing in the protected waters behind Goose Spit, world class cross country and downhill skiing on "Mount Washington":http://www.mountwashington.ca/ , hiking in the mountains and lakes of Strathcona Provincial Park are all accessible from the Comox Valley. For the fisherman we can offer river, lake and salt water angling, for the golfer we have half a dozen courses and for the kids a day at the beach. For the family there is camping, canoeing, kayaking, mountain biking and horse riding.

If you just want to relax; then pull up a bench in one of our many "parks":parks-fields and admire the view. Perhaps try your hand at bird spotting in one of the nearby sanctuaries, or amble down to one of our marinas, and sit and watch the comings and goings of sail and motor craft, ending the day with some fresh Halibut, Salmon, Tuna, Crab or Prawns bought directly from a fishing boat at the wharf.

A visit to one of our four museums can be very rewarding. "The Comox Archives and Museum Society":http://www.comoxmuseum.ca/ is located in downtown Comox. Every month there is a new display of interest to Comox Residents. Learn about mining in "Cumberland":http://www.cumberlandmuseum.ca/cgi-bin/show_home.cgi, dinosaurs in "Courtenay":http://www.courtenaymuseum.ca/ or aviation at "CFB Comox.":http://www.comoxairforcemuseum.ca/

If you are a photographer or artist how about a foreground of tall masts screening a blue expanse of water, perhaps broken by a diminutive tug pulling a log-boom. And in the near distance (the other side of the bay) a mountain skyline dominated by the white splash of the Comox Glacier all set against a blue sky. If you prefer something a little more intimate, you may like to set up your easel or unsheathe your long lens in the gazebo set in the wetland sanctuary at the head of the harbour and try for a goose, swan, duck, crane, or one of the many other birds and fowls frequenting the area. Eagle and Harbour Seal call Comox their home, and deer still wander our streets looking for an unprotected vegetable garden or fruit tree.

h2. Entertainment

Comox, and the surrounding area boasts a variety of world class artists. Each year on the first weekend in August the "Filberg Festival":http://www.filbergfestival.com/ is held in Comox. This feast for the senses provides a forum for hundreds of artists and performers to display their work and entertain for three days. "CYMC":http://www.cymc.ca/, a three week summer music festival and workshop attracts each year young musicians from far afield.

bq. "Yes, Comox has it all, culture, sports, education, scenic beauty the "great outdoors", mild climate and the village lifestyle. All here for us to experience, maintain and enjoy."

Comox is a wonderful community, located half way up Vancouver Island, at the northern end of the Strait of Georgia. We are a jumping off place for vessels transiting to Alaska or heading to Desolation Sound. We are a friendly community that is concerned about our environment and cherishes our green spaces.</p>

The Town is in excellent financial shape while our taxes are one of the lowest on Vancouver Island. Our airport, which services the entire Comox Valley, has regularly scheduled flights to both Vancouver (30 minutes away) and Calgary (1 hour 15 minutes away). This may be one of the reasons that so many people choose our valley to vacation. It may also be that we have the third largest ski resort in British Columbia, our own glacier, fabulous mountains and mountain biking, kayaking, hiking, fishing and year round golf. Or it could just be that we have wonderful people who care about visitors. We would like you to visit and enjoy our wonderful shops, restaurants, pubs, parks, playgrounds, golf courses and marina.

Comox is open for business, we'd love to see you here.

Comox is located on the eastern side of Vancouver Island, 107 km (66 miles) north of Nanaimo and 220 km (137 miles) north of Victoria. The four lane Inland Island Highway #19 makes travel to Comox faster than before. The trip between Nanaimo and Comox now takes less than an hour and a half. The older ocean side highway, Highway 19A, provides an alternate route in which visitors can enjoy the scenery of Vancouver Island's coastal communities. This can be driven in a couple of hours, but may take you days if you take advantage of the many campsites, motels and resorts.

p(fr). !http://comox.ca/site-graphics/filberg2page.jpg!

The Filberg Lodge and nine acres of beautifully landscaped grounds are located on the harbour near the end of Comox Avenue. The estate was originally built for R.J. Filberg in 1929, and became a public facility after his death in 1977. The Heritage Filberg Lodge and and Park Association (a non-profit society) manages and develops the property on behalf of the municipality.

p(cr). The rustic *Filberg Lodge* is a reflection of the skills of local craftsmen in the use of stone and timber. The original stonework was done by stone mason and head gardener William Meier. The Lodge's warm interior complements the outside appearance with extensive hand-made woodwork and stonework.

The *Gardens* are a myriad of exotic and local trees and flowers. A wonderful place for a peaceful stroll or an afternoon picnic.

The *Totem Pole* was created by Richard Krenz and donated by Gordon and Ivy Wagner. The totem pole features the crests of the four main families of the Comox native people.

The *Hands on Farm*, operated by the Town of Comox during the summer months, houses various farm animals. Admission is *free* for 5 years and under; *$2.00* forÂ six years and older; *$5.00* for a family day pass and *$30.00* for a family season's pass. Admission is by* donation* during the Filberg Festival. (2005 rates)

The *Herb garden*,Â inviting to both the eye and the nose, is located just above the Tea House. The Garden was planted by the Comox Valley Horticultural Society.

The *Tea House*, open from May through September; (May 1, 11:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m. and starting in June the hours will increase to 11:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m.), offers morning coffee, lunches, and afteroon teas. The Tea House is situated in a restored outbuilding with a vine-covered patio and an excellent view. To reserve the Tea House call 339-1831.

p(fr). !http://comox.ca/site-graphics/expectdeersmall.jpg!

Expect deer on our roads and in your yard.

Visitors to Comox are often surprised to see deer wandering through our parks, greenways, streets and even private yards.

*Please observe our warning signs, expect deer, and drive carefully.*

Comox residents may have a different reaction to the presence of deer, particularly if the deer have beenÂ eating their way throughÂ gardens or orchards.

*Here are some thoughtsÂ about deer behaviour, and suggestions for dealing with troublesome deer in ways that do not hurt them:*

* An adult deer eats at least 3 kg of vegetation daily.Â  They need protein so they prefer legumes and sweet plants in rich well fertilized soil.Â  Berries, grains & fruit are also favourites.Â  Therefore substitute unsavoury plants for desirable ones or plant the edibles on the outside of your garden.
* Deer trust their noses, are curious, rely on habit, listen, and communicate with each other.Â  In a non-threatening environment (like Comox) they quickly learn that they are safe, and make themselves at home.
* Design your garden to discourage deer by creating uninviting entryways, and providing no view or landing sites (to fence leapers).Â  Mix preferred plant types with undesirable ones.Â  Consider using xeriscape landscaping (drought resistant plants) which generally are undesirable to deer.
* Be tidy and keep edible materials picked up (for instance fallen fruit).
* Deterrents to deer include foul smells (soap, hair, garlic, rotten eggs, and commercial compounds), movement (flags, scarecrows, or motion sensitive sprayers), floodlights or sounds (please be sensitive to your neighbours), and fencing (adult deer can jump a 2 metre high fence if they want to).Â  Remember that deer learn quickly that these deterrents are not really dangerous, so theyÂ only work for a while.
* Be considerate of your neighbours.Â  Don't use deterrents that irritate them more than the deer, and don't attract the deer to your neighbourhood byÂ leaving out food.Â  Please remember that foodÂ will not only attract deer, but other animals, even less desirable.

Here are some links that may provide you with more ideas:

*Effective September 13, 2010 the Comox Valley Regional District and the Vancouver Island Health Authority are removing the boil water notice for the users of the Comox Valley Water System.*

The boil water advisory has been removed from the Comox Valley Water System because three complete sets of satisfactory water tests have been received since a single sample in last weekâs set of regular Regional District water tests was positive for e-coli bacteria. The Townâs water is now safe to use for all purposes.

After a boil water notice is ended, you are recommended to you run cold water faucets and fountains for 1 minute before using the water, to drain and flush ice making machines, to run water softeners through a regeneration cycle, to drain and refill hot water tanks if they are less than 45 degrees celcius in temperature (normal is 60 degrees), and to change any water pre-treatment filters that you use.

h2. Background

Comox (along with the City of Courtenay and several Electoral Area water systems) buys its drinking water from the Regional District. The Regional Districtâs water originates at Comox Lake, although the water is drawn from the BC Hydro penstock for most of the year, except when the penstock is being maintained, at which time it is drawn from the Puntledge River beside the BC Hydro generating station. The Regional District checks the water taken for turbidity, and then adds chlorine for purification. It takes six water samples from downstream locations through its water system weekly. Last week one of those samples (from the Arden Road water system) tested positive for e-coli bacteria, and so the boil water notice was issued for the whole of the Regional water system.

In addition to the testing that the Regional District performs, the Town of Comox takes five water samples per week from locations around Comox. We have yet to have a sample test positive for e-coli in Comox. And in addition to scheduled testing by the Regional District and the Town, the Vancouver Island Health Authority takes water samples at random to verify the work we are performing.

For additional information on water testing and water quality, please note the related item links below.

We appreciate the co-operation of the public with the boil water advisory that was issued last week. And while there was no evidence of widespread contamination in the Regional water system or in Comox, the boil water notice was issued out of caution, because there was a small chance that could occur. Our staff will continue to act to preserve the security of our water, and protect public health."""

Residential pickup of recycling continues bi-weekly in 2010. For full details consult our __COMOX RECYCLES GUIDE__ under related items at bottom of this page.

h4. CHANGE FROM BLUE BAGS TO BLUE BOXES:

The use of BLUE BAGS for recycling has been phased out and replaced with a BLUE BOX system - starting on January 1, 2009 blue bags were no longer collected. At the start of this program one blue box was distributed to each single family home and duplex in Comox on a one-time basis.  This blue box became the private property of the property owner.  You must have at least one blue box to take part in the program. Click here for some reasoning behind the Change from BLUE BAGS to BLUE BOXES and HOW TO PURCHASE ONE.

h4. HOW TO USE THE BLUE BOX:

Please place mixed (unsorted) recyclables into the blue box (just as you used to in the blue bag), however do not place a paper product inside a plastic product - such as shredded paper inside a plastic bag - instead put paper inside paper such as shredded paper inside a paper bag or cardboard box. Plastic shopping bags and plastic wrap can now be added to the mixed recyclabels, if clean.

h4. NO GLASS!  NO STYROFOAM!  We cannot recycle these.

If your blue box is full, extra recyclables can be placed in any other open container next to the blue box -ensure that these additional containers do not exceed the basic dimensions of the blue box and remember the weight limit on all containers of 35 pounds - *NO LIMITS ON RECYCLING QUANTITIES*.

Water Conservation

The Town, as a customer of the Comox Valley water system, is subject to the water use restrictions enacted by the Comox Valley Regional District. Since 2006 there have been year-round restrictions on sprinkling. These were recently updated when the Comox Valley Regional District adopted a new bylaw (No. 129).
This Regional District Bylaw No. 129 (see Related Content box at bottom of page) has a three-stage water conservation program. Restrictions apply year-round starting with Stage 1.  Stage 2 will generally be in effect from June 1 until September 30th, but can be implemented earlier and maintained later if required. And Stage 3, the most restrictive level of water use, is imposed as required based upon water availability and demand.  The public will be notified of the change to Stage 2 or 3 through the local newspaper and radio or you may wish to phone a local municipal hall or visit a website - see the Contact Information at the bottom of this page.

Please note, that although this is a Regional District Bylaw it can be enforced by bylaw enforcement officers from both the Town of Comox and the Regional District. If you wish to report a non-compliance, within the Town's boundary, please contact Comox Town Hall and be prepared to provide the address of concern.

Should you have concerns about the restrictions within the Bylaw itself please contact the Comox Valley Regional District office directly at 250-334-6000.

Staff presented the revised draft of the full Financial Plan along with draft Financial Plan (2010 â 2014) and 2010 Tax Rate Bylaws for the Committee to review and discuss.  The proposed Town General Tax increase for 2010 is 3.7% for residential taxpayers and 3.2% for business assessment. When combined with this yearâs freeze on utility fees and parcel taxes, the net effect of the Financial Plan on an average single family home will be an increase of $27.61. The Committee recommended making two changes to the Plan â shifting $176,100 that was budgeted for debt repayment to a capital reserve for affordable housing initiatives, and reducing the contribution from the water fund to a water meter replacement reserve in 2012 â 2014 (limiting the contribution in those years to the $25,000 budgeted in 2011). Then the Committee recommended that the bylaws be forwarded to Council (scheduled to meet May 5th) for three readings.

 

h4. April 14th Committee of the Whole

Staff presented the first draft of the full Financial Plan (revenue, department expenditures and capital expenditures) for 2010 through 2014 for the Committee to review and discuss.  Based on a 2010 tax increase of just under 4%, the Committee reviewed these budgets and recommended a number of changes to reduce net expenditures. These changes included a $10,000 reduction to 2010 Council travel and conference, $2,000 reduction to 2010 Mayorâs travel and conference, $5,000 from 2010 bylaw enforcement (for misc expenditures), and a $2,500 increase to the grants to the Sid Williams Theatre from the Town for 2010. Council will have to ratify these changes, then a final draft financial plan (including bylaw) will be submitted to the Committee April 28th. Council must adopt the Financial Plan bylaw (and a Tax Rates bylaw) by May 14th. 

 

h4. March 10th Committee of the Whole

Staff presented the first draft of the Public Protection (Police, Fire Department, Building Inspection) and Planning budgets for 2010 through 2014 for the Committee to review and discuss.  These budgets show projected expenditures for these services.  The cover memo explains that this first draft was prepared on the same basis as prior years with no significant changes to operations proposed for any of these departments. The Planning budget has significant project expenditures (for review of the Official Community Plan, and development of a comprehensive pedestrian and traffic safety study in 2010) that have an increased for 2010. 

 

h4. February 24th Committee of the Whole

Staff presented the first draft of municipal utility (garbage, water, and sewer) service's budgets for 2010 through 2014 for the Committee to review and discuss.  These budgets show both revenue and expenditures (operating and capital) for these services, along with the net surplus or shortfall in projected net revenue for the next five years.  The cover memo explains that this first draft was prepared on the basis of no overall rate increases in 2010 or subsequent years, but due to a net shorfall of revenue in the water fund, this will be harder to maintain there than in the garbage and sewer services.  The memo says that Council might want to consider transfering $15 from the sewer parcel tax to the water parcel tax starting in 2011 to help deal with this.  Holding fees steady for all three services is dependent upon resource utilization remaining steady (or declining in the case of the water service) and no significant increases to fees charged by the Regional District for operation of the landfill, supply of water and treatment of sewage. 

 

h4. February 10th Committee of the Whole

Staff presented two reports to the Committee to start its work on the upcoming Financial Plan in earnest.  The first memo explained the requirement (of the Community Charter) that we include Revenue Objectives & Policies as part of our annual five-year Financial Plan.  The memo went on to review the Objectives & Policies adopted in the last Plan.  Arising from discussion, the Committee passed a motion to delete Section 2 of Revenue Policies.  In 2009 this Section said that there would be a 4% general tax increases to all classes of property from 2009 to 2013.  If Council adopts the Committee's recommendation, this would free up Council to have different general tax increases in different years, and to vary the increases by property class.

Next, the Committee was provided with worksheets updating the balance of, and committments made to date from the Town's Federal Gas Taxes (Community Works) Funds.  These come to Canadian municipalities from the Federal Government, and must be spent on "green" capital expenditures and on capacity building studies.  The Committee passed a motion to increase the funding allocation for energy efficiency upgrades of Town buildings to $250,000 including a lighting upgrade to the firehall and a study of geothermal heating at the Recreation Centre this year.

Finally, the Committee was presented with a first draft of a Capital Plan for 2010 to 2014.  Capital expenditures form roughly 25% of our total expenditures, so they have a significant effect on the revenue needed over the next five years.  The Committee passed a motion to advance the budget for constructing a (yet to be selected or designed) bike lanes from 2013 in the Financial Plan to 2011.

 

h4. February 3rd Regular Council Meeting

Council received and adopted its Strategic Plan for 2010 to 2014.  This is a high level document that lays out Council's three strategic priorities over the next five years: 

* *Sustainable Infrastructure* (related goals:  improving road & sidewalk condition, maintaining utilities infrastructure, and assessing future infrastructure needs)
* *Sustainability and Livability* (related goals:  increase environmental responsibility, increase recreational opportunities, increase long-range planning activities, become a more inclusive community, increase local economic development opportunities, and increase health services)
* *Good Governance* (related goals: improve/maintain high level of customer service, impvoe communication with public, enable and motivate staff, and support regional initiatives).
These Strategies and Goals will be reflected in the upcoming Financial Plan.

 

h4. January 27th Committee of the Whole

Staff presented two reports to Council's Committee of the Whole (so called because all Council members sit on this Committee).  The first was a report on the initial (Completed) Assessment Roll for 2010.  The next was a report reviewing the 2009 - 2013 Financial Plan (adopted last year).  At its next meeting (February 10th) the Committee will discuss its Revenue Objectives & Policies that determine what rate increases will be built into its new Financial Plan.  Both of the staff reports at this meeting are now listed on the related items (items 01 & 02 below).  They were received and discussed by the Committee, but no motions arose from the discussion.  Had any motions related to the Financial Plan been adopted by the Committee, they would be subject to ratification at a Regular Council Meeting.

 

h4. Background

Municipalities in BC are governed by the Community Charter, which requires them to adopt annually by bylaw, five-year Financial Plans.  This must be done before a property tax bylaw is adopted.  The deadline for both is May 14th of each year.  Until adoption of a new Financial Plan bylaw, the bylaw from the previous year provides the legal authority for expenditures.

*Explanation of the Town's 2010 Meter Program, with application attached:*
h2. Background to the water metering program
 
Comox buys its water from a Regional District water system that provides Courtenay, Comox and certain rural service areas with their water.  Last year the Town spent $1.4 Million buying 2.6 billion litres of water.  This Regional District water system has a licenced annual limit on the water that it can draw of just over 9 billion litres per year.  In order to comply with its licence over the long-term despite a growing population of users, the Regional District has adopted a water efficiency plan that proposes a 27% reduction in water use through a broad series of initiatives including water metering, public education, low flow toilet rebates, faucet & showerhead replacements, rain barrels, leak detection and repairs, water use restrictions and enforcement.  Of all these activities, water meters are predicted to provide most of the water use reductions.

The Town will participate in these programs in order to help the Regional Districtâs water system reach its targets.  We are helping to distribute the information on toilet and rain barrel rebates.  We already repair any water leaks reported, and we will work with the Regional District to detect previously unknown leaks, which we will then fix.  We have already been replacing water appliances (toilets & faucets) in Town buildings with more efficient ones.  That process will continue in 2010.  We will be working with the public on water education and will build a demonstration low watering (xeriscaping) boulevard (site still remains to be determined).  And we will continue to investigate complaints received about violations of sprinkling regulations, as we have in prior years.

With regard to water meters, Council has decided to implement a residential metering project in 2010 that would meter residential strata customers, meter ready homes, and other customers who ask for meters to be installed.  *Council also decided that the customers who get a meter will be allowed to keep paying flat-rate user fees unless they volunteer to be billed by their metered water use.*

The cost of this metering program ($1,350,000) is funded $471,000 from the Regional District, $450,000 from Federal Gas Taxes, $250,000 from our Water Fund Capital Reserves, and $179,000 from 2010 Water Fund User Fees.  No debt will be needed to pay for these meters nor did we have to raise water user fees this year to pay for this project.

We expect that this project could meter up to 40% of our residential customers since there are strata developments including over 1,000 residential units in Comox and over 900 meter ready homes

Installation of meters will begin this summer.  Then we will begin reading the meters, and share the data back with the owners of the metered residences.  The soonest they would be able to switch (*if they want*) to metered billing would be for 2011 (2010 fees will already have been billed with property taxes and paid by July 2nd).

We currently charge residential water customers $303 per year for their water use.  Metered businesses are charged $0.78 / m3 for metered use of water.  We have only gathered a limited amount of data on residential water use in Comox, because less than 200 Comox homes have water meters.  But the data we do have (from the homes with meters) shows that many homeowners use less water than average, so they could reduce what they are paying for water by volunteering to be billed by their meter.  The choice will rest with individual property owners and the strata councils, once they know from their own meter readings what their consumption patterns are.

 

h3. Questions weâve been asked about this program so far

Q: *Who can ask for a meter to be installed?*

Any residential property owner who is not in a strata unit or a meter ready home (since those homes will get a meter already).

Q: *How do I know whether my home is meter ready or not?*

If you have a meter box then your home is meter ready.  Since 2001 subdivisions in Comox have included a meter box installed for each water connection.  As well, there have been other homes made meter ready if we were repairing their water services.  Those have meter boxes on their connections too. 

Q: *How much will the Town charge to install a meter?*

We are not charging home owners or residential strata to install their meters.  That being said, this program is partially funded out of our water system, which we all pay into.

 

Q: *What if I donât want the Town to install a meter in my meter box?*

Sorry, but if your house has a meter box already, we will be installing a meter under this program.  The Town has the right to do that under its Water Regulations & Rates Bylaw adopted in 1979.  The key is that Councilâs motion allows you to continue to pay flat water rates unless you volunteer to be billed by your meter.

Q: *How often will the meters be read?*

The meters will be read electronically so we can read them as often as required.  This will likely be monthly â particularly as we expand our data gathering on residential water use and try to reconcile it to our monthly water purchases.

Q: *How often will the Town bill residential metered customers?*

That has yet to be finalized, but the likely answer is either two or four times per year.  We are implementing new billing software, but there is still a cost associated with billing customers and we will want to be as efficient as we can.

Q: *What if my meter shows that there is a water leak on my water connection?*

The meter is installed at the connection point between the Townâs system and your property.  If there is a water leak beyond the meter, it is on your property and it is your responsibility to call a plumber to fix it. 

Q: *What if there is a leak on private property and the owner will not fix it?*

Our current water fees bylaw allows us to charge metered residences that use an excessive amount of water (which we define as average water use over time of 52 or more m3 of water per month).  If a property has a leak and the owner will not fix it, then we will bill the owner for this use.  We chose 52 cubic metres (52,000 litres) of average water use per month as the amount of residential water use that we consider excessive because it is more than twice the amount of water that we think most homes use (on average) through a year.

Q: *If I volunteer to be billed by the meter and then increase my water use in the future, can I go back to flat-rate billing?

No â the purpose of installing meters is in part to encourage people to reduce their water use over the long term. 

Q: *If meters are installed this year, is 2011 my only opportunity to volunteer for metered billing?*

No â we will continue reporting water use to owners even if they donât switch in 2011.  Then, if they want to switch in 2012, or later years, they can still do that.  However, because we bill flat-rate residential water fees on tax notices, owners will have to switch at the start of a year.

Q: *If I get a meter and then donât volunteer to be billed by its readings, how long can I keep paying flat rates?*

Councilâs motion was open-ended.  There was no deadline for switching.

Q: *How much could I save with a meter?*

The only way you will know for sure is if you ask for a meter to be installed and then see how much water you use.  After that, you can calculate whether or not you could save anything and decide whether or not to change to metered billing.

Q: *Why did the Town pick meter ready homes and residential strata for this project?*

We can meter more of these customers for less cost than single family homes that are not meter ready (because of landscaping restoration costs). 

Q: *Is there a limit to how many residences could ask for a meter this year?*

Yes.  Most of our budget for the project is allocated to the meter ready homes and residential strata.  What budget is left will probably fund 100 to 200 additional homes volunteering for meters.  So, if you want to be included, we encourage you to contact us as soon as possible and get on our list of installations. 

Q: *What is involved with installing a meter?*

If a property is meter ready then we lift the lid on the meter box, turn off the service for a few minutes, and install the meter.  There is minimal cost and disruption of service.  No digging is required, assuming that the meter box hasnât been disturbed since it was installed.

For homes without meter boxes, we have to dig up the water service at the edge of the property and install several pieces of hardware including a meter setter (goose-necked pieces of pipe that have a shutoff valve on one side and a backflow preventer on the other, with a space for the meter in between), a meter box, the meter and a small transmitter with a battery.  Then we restore the landscaping (lawn, plants, or sometimes even a driveway) where we dug up the service, to return the property (as best we can) to its original state.

Q: *Wouldnât it be simpler to install a meter in the house?*

While for many homes that might be true, there are a number of problems with that, including getting future access to the meter in case we need to maintain or replace it.  Also, because irrigation systems usually tie into the service line going to the house, an inside meter would miss the water used by most irrigation systems. 

Q: *How do I get a meter installed?*
